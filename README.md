<h1>Analyzing Gender Representation in the Olympics with Python</h1>

<h3>Project Description:</h3>
This project explores the evolution of gender participation in the Olympic Games using a historical dataset of athletes. The analysis focuses on trends in male and female participation across both the Summer and Winter Games, highlighting how gender representation has changed over time and identifying moments of participation fluctuation.
By combining data cleaning, grouping, visualization, and contextual research, this project aims to answer:
How has female participation evolved in the Olympic Games over time?
Have women reached parity with men in terms of athlete count?
What historical or political events may explain sudden drops in participation?

<h3>Tools and Libraries Used:</h3>
<li>Python (in Google Colab)</li>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>Matplotlib</li>
<li>Plotly</li>

<h4>Notes:</h4>
This is a personal project built to apply Python, data science, and sports analytics skills using real-world data. It is not affiliated with the IOC or any official organization.
